# GTFelinux

2020

Our first group project which took part in our 4th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #49 Bootcamp @Aveiro. 

### The idea

We received a challenge about creating a game in Java within a week. With a few challenges, we had to decide what kind of game it should be. We ended up deciding on a game like the first GTA and that the main character should be a cat trying to get his milk and having the option to kill anything in his way.

### The Development

We started with a brainstorm to reach an agreement on the project. Then we drew the class UML, made the git repo, and organized the git flow. We then spent a few hours discussing who should do what and made sure everyone understood how it would work. 
Everyone organically chose where to work on, and since everyone was following the architecture, we were able to pull off a great amount of work without much conflict.   

### Tech && Methodologies
